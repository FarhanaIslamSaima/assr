            <p className='text-justify px-5 mt-4 text-md mt-[50px]'>ASSR, the only science club of RUET was founded in 2013 by a couple of science enthusiastic students of the Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology. Since then we have flourished with time. Our main principle is to make science more accessible and enjoyable to the young generation. Our club's members are generally enthusiastic about astronomy and adore making knowledge more accessible and science more fun to students. We have records of organizing many successful school camps around Rajshahi. Our target is most likely schools that are underprivileged. We helped them to do basic scientific experiments and make them understand how things work. We also arranged Sky Observation Camps, Reading Cycles, Research Paper Reading, Science Talks, Science Fiction Movie session etc. segments to make science and astronomy more enjoyable among the students of the Northern part of Bangladesh. We also celebrate Einstine’s birthday and Pi Day, Light Day, and “Protostar” - an introductory segment for the freshers of the university from where they can know about our organization. For the last few months, we have been trying to expand our work throughout the country. For this, we had arranged a national event. "Aurora: Science Festival 2023" was arranged to make science enjoyable to students. Students from all around the country participated in project showcasing and poster presentations. We set olympiads for students from junior to higher Secondary level. And maybe the most anticipated part of the event was to hold a session on astronomy by Md. Kaykobad sir and Khan M B Asad sir. You might have seen our Facebook page. Although our previous page was hacked, we are again trying to bring back our audiences together through our new page. We try to publish quality content, updating people about the latest scientific discoveries.</p>
